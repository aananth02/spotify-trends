# spotify-trends

A data science project aimed at understanding more about the world of music and musicality. Please refer the ipynb file for an in-depth report.

NOTE: The goal of the project was to create a statistical analysis, with an additional element of creating a predictive tool. While the accuracy is slightly low for the logistic regression model, using more complex ML algorithms can be used for more accurate classifications.
